You are an AI pair programmer helping me create a very small teaching project called **“Mini Survey”**.
Your task: create or update the files listed below to implement a minimal full-stack app with a Python backend and a tiny HTML+JS frontend.
Please only touch the files explicitly listed. If a file does not exist, create it.

---

## Stack and project layout

Use:

- Backend: Python 3 + Flask
- Frontend: simple HTML + vanilla JavaScript (no build tools, no frameworks)

Project structure (create these files and folders if they don’t exist):

- app.py – Flask backend
- templates/index.html – HTML page with a simple UI
- static/app.js – JS logic for fetching questions and sending answers
- requirements.txt – Python dependencies
- README.md – short instructions on how to run the app

The app should be runnable locally with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py

Then open the app in the browser (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

## Functional requirements

### Backend (Flask in app.py)

Implement a small HTTP API with two endpoints:

1. GET /questions
   - Returns a fixed list of 3–5 survey questions.
   - Questions are hardcoded in the backend (no database).
   - Response format: JSON array of objects, for example:

        [
          { "id": 1, "text": "What is your name?" },
          { "id": 2, "text": "How old are you?" },
          { "id": 3, "text": "What is your favorite programming language?" }
        ]

2. POST /answers
   - Accepts a JSON payload with the user’s answers to the questions.
   - Example payload shape (you can define exact structure, but keep it simple and clear in code comments):

        {
          "answers": [
            { "questionId": 1, "answer": "Alice" },
            { "questionId": 2, "answer": "21" }
          ]
        }

   - Stores the answers in memory only for the lifetime of the app, e.g. in a global Python list:

        stored_answers = []

   - Appends each new submission to this in-memory list.
   - Returns a simple JSON response like:

        { "status": "ok" }

3. Frontend serving
   - The Flask app should:
     - Serve index.html at route / using render_template.
     - Serve static/app.js as a static file (standard Flask static setup).
   - This way, the frontend and backend share the same origin, and no CORS configuration is needed.

4. Code style
   - Keep the Flask app small, readable, and beginner-friendly.
   - Include short comments explaining what each route does.
   - Add a if __name__ == "__main__": block to run the app with debug=True for local development.

5. Dependencies
   - In requirements.txt, include at least:

        flask

### Frontend (templates/index.html and static/app.js)

The frontend is a minimal web page that talks to the backend.

Behavior:

1. On page load:
   - app.js should call GET /questions.
   - After receiving the questions, render them as a simple HTML form.
   - Each question should have a corresponding input field (you can use <input type="text"> or <textarea> for all questions to keep it simple).

2. On form submission:
   - Collect all answers from the input fields.
   - Build a JSON object that matches the expected format for POST /answers.
   - Send the data to the backend using fetch with:
     - method: "POST"
     - headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
     - body: JSON.stringify(...)

3. After a successful response:
   - Hide the form (or disable it) and show a message:
     - "Thank you for your answers!"
   - This message can be a simple <div> rendered dynamically by JS.

index.html requirements:

- Use a basic HTML5 skeleton.
- Include a <div id="app"></div> that will be populated by JavaScript.
- Include the script:

      <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='app.js') }}"></script>

- Optionally, you can add very minimal CSS styles inline or via a simple <style> block (but keep it small and readable).

app.js requirements:

- On DOMContentLoaded, fetch questions from /questions.
- Render the questions inside #app as a <form> with:
  - a label for each question
  - an input field
  - a submit button
- Attach a submit event listener to the form that:
  - prevents default behavior
  - collects answers
  - sends them via POST /answers
  - on success, replaces the form content with a simple <p>Thank you for your answers!</p>.

- Include short comments to make it easy for a student to follow the logic.

### README (README.md)

Create a short README.md that explains:

1. What the project is: a simple “Mini Survey” full-stack example.
2. How to set it up:

       python -m venv .venv
       source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scriptsctivate on Windows
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       python app.py

3. Where to open the application in the browser (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
4. Briefly describe the two API endpoints and the basic behavior of the app.

What you should do now:

1. Create or update the files:
   - app.py
   - templates/index.html
   - static/app.js
   - requirements.txt
   - README.md
2. Ensure the app runs locally and the described flow works:
   - Open / → questions are loaded
   - User fills in the form → sends answers via POST /answers
   - Backend stores answers in memory
   - Frontend shows “Thank you for your answers!” message on success

Make the code clean, well-organized, and easy for a beginner to read and learn from.
